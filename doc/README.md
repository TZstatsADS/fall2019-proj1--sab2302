# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

Final File for HTML : Proj_Lyrics_Analysis.rmd. If you choose correct path of cleaned dataset then it can generate HTML. 

Rough Work : P1_Rough_Work.rmd. This file covers all rough commands and test work before finalizing Final file. 

Data Cleaning and Processing: Text_Processing.rmd is used which was available as a part of project. I have saved final dataset with cleaned_Lyrics. Rest is same.

Lyrics_ShinyApp & Proj1_desc were available and not touched.
